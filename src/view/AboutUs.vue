            The Purple Vest Mission is an initiative which promotes accessibility preparedness in
            times of emergency for people with disabilities and the elderly. The Purple Vest Mission
            was initiated on March 2022 by Access Israel who is the leading organization in Israel
            promoting accessibility and inclusion for all types of disabilities in all areas of
            life. As leaders of accessibility and inclusion in Israel, Access Israel is very
            experienced and active in shaping the preparedness of Israel in times of emergency
            making sure people with disabilities and elderly are not left behind. Access Israel led
            round tables with stakeholders to understand challenges, needs and possible solutions
            and conducted training various stakeholders for preparedness in time of emergency and
            with being part of the advanced legislation process resulting in regulations on
            preparedness in times of emergency.&nbsp;

          <p>
            When the war broke in Ukraine, Access Israel understood the need to focus on making sure
            solutions on the ground fit those most vulnerable – the elderly and those with
            disabilities. The requests for help started to come, calling for help for specific and
            unique needs for people with disabilities. Access Israel immediately understood that
            people with disabilities and the elderly are left behind and are not evacuated because
            the complexity of arranging accessible evacuation and because of lack of available
            information on this subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access Israel immediately decided to initiate the “<strong>Purple Vest Mission</strong>”
            – Our overall long-term goal is to create contingency plans for people with disabilities
            and the elderly globally, to ensure preparedness and a plan for times of emergency.
            <strong>Purple Vest mission</strong> is focused on people with disabilities and the
            elderly and their families.&nbsp;

          <h3>Why Purple Vest?</h3>
          <p>
            The idea behind the purple vest itself is that when people with disabilities and the
            elderly see a person wearing a purple vest (with the color purple which is identified
            with rights for people with disabilities) they will know that this person was trained
            and has the tools to provide assistance in an accessible way.

                  In April 2022, we received a generous donation from The Nippon Foundation from
                  Japan and other donors, enabling us to provide and fund accessible complex
                  evacuations, provide supplies, contacts and other information for people with
                  disabilities and elderly in Ukraine and raise awareness and conduct trainings both
                  virtual and face-to-face to volunteers and organizations operating in and around
                  Ukraine to provide tools on making the efforts they provide during these difficult
                  times more accessible and fitting for people with disabilities and the elderly.

                  In December 2022 we received the support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
                  israel and continuous support of Accessibility Accelerator from the USA enabling
                  us to continue the efforts of making sure people with disabilities and elderly are
                  considered and part of preparing for times of emergency, focusing on awareness,
                  information, training and continuing to connect the dots between those operating
                  on the ground making sure people with disabilities and elderly are not left
                  behind.
