    # Pain Points Analysis

    ## Overview
    The **Pain Points** segment identifies and analyzes the primary challenges faced by the target audience (as defined in the User Personas
    analysis) when interacting with IT products, including browser extensions, desktop software, mobile apps, and SaaS platforms. This analysis
    leverages user behavior data, market research, and regional insights to highlight common frustrations and barriers across five key
    personas: Freelance Creative, SME Business Owner, Enterprise IT Manager, Tech-Savvy Millennial, and Budget-Conscious Consumer. The insights
    aim to guide product development and UX design to address these issues, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.
